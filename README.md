## 🎯 Vision

A transparent, automated leave management tool that helps employees track their leave days and allows managers to review requests efficiently — fully compliant with labor law requirements.

**Key business rules:**
- Each employee has a default of **12 leave days per year**
- Unused leave days at year-end are **accumulated (carried over)** to the next year (max 6 days)
- Managers can **approve or reject** leave requests with notes
- Automated **year-end accumulation job** runs on January 1st at 00:00

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 or higher (`java -version`)
- Node.js 18+ (`node -v`)
- PostgreSQL 16+ (`psql --version`)
- Maven (`mvn -version`)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized setup)

### Option 1 — Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/leave-management-system.git
cd leave-management-system

# Start all services (backend + frontend + database)
docker-compose up --build
```

App will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8080`
- pgAdmin: `http://localhost:5050`

### Option 2 — Run Manually

**1. Set up the database**

```bash
# Create database
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE leave_management;"
```

**2. Configure environment variables**

Create `backend/src/main/resources/application-local.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/leave_management
    username: postgres
    password: your_password
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate

app:
  jwt:
    secret: your-secret-key-min-256-bits
    expiration: 28800000  # 8 hours in ms
```

**3. Run the backend**

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=local
```

**4. Run the frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
